Research Track I - Assignment 2
================================

This project shows up a mobile robot moving in a 3D space, which has to reach a desired position by avoiding obstacles. This happens in a virtual environment, managed by the standard virtual simulator of ROS, called Gazebo.

To achieve this, the project requires to implement:
- (a) A node that implements an action client, allowing the user to set a target (x, y) or to cancel it. The node also publishes the robot position and velocity as a custom message (x,y, vel_x, vel_z), by relying on the values published on the topic /odom.
- (b) A service node that, when called, prints the number of goals reached and cancelled;
- (c) A node that subscribes to the robot’s position and velocity (using the custom message) and prints the distance of the robot from the target and the robot’s average speed.

Installing and running
----------------------
To run the program, we have to install xterm:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install xterm
```
and SciPy
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3-scipy
```
Go inside the src folder of your ROS workspace and clone the assignment folder:
```bash
$ git clone
```
Then, from the root directory of your ROS workspace run the command:
```bash
$ catkin_make
```
You can run ROSCORE in a terminal or skip it. Anyway, it will be runned automatically. Run the below to start the program.
```bash
$ roslaunch assignment_2_2022 assignment2.launch
```

## Troubleshooting
Check your python version running:
```bash
$ python --version
```
If it appears Python 3, there is no problem. If appears Python 2, run this:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-is-python3
```

## Exercise
-----------------------------

To run one or more scripts in the simulator, use `run.py`, passing it the file names. 

I am proposing you three exercises, with an increasing level of difficulty.
The instruction for the three exercises can be found inside the .py files (exercise1.py, exercise2.py, exercise3.py).

When done, you can run the program with:

```bash
$ python run.py exercise1.py
```

You have also the solutions of the exercises (folder solutions)

```bash
$ python run.py solutions/exercise1_solution.py
```

Robot API
---------

The API for controlling a simulated robot is designed to be as similar as possible to the [SR API][sr-api].

### Motors ###

The simulated robot has two motors configured for skid steering, connected to a two-output [Motor Board](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/kit/motor_board). The left motor is connected to output `0` and the right motor to output `1`.

The Motor Board API is identical to [that of the SR API](https://studentrobotics.org/docs/programming/sr/motors/), except that motor boards cannot be addressed by serial number. So, to turn on the spot at one quarter of full power, one might write the following:

```python
R.motors[0].m0.power = 25
R.motors[0].m1.power = -25
```

### The Grabber ###

The robot is equipped with a grabber, capable of picking up a token which is in front of the robot and within 0.4 metres of the robot's centre. To pick up a token, call the `R.grab` method:

```python
success = R.grab()
```

The `R.grab` function returns `True` if a token was successfully picked up, or `False` otherwise. If the robot is already holding a token, it will throw an `AlreadyHoldingSomethingException`.

To drop the token, call the `R.release` method.

Cable-tie flails are not implemented.

### Vision ###

To help the robot find tokens and navigate, each token has markers stuck to it, as does each wall. The `R.see` method returns a list of all the markers the robot can see, as `Marker` objects. The robot can only see markers which it is facing towards.

Each `Marker` object has the following attributes:

* `info`: a `MarkerInfo` object describing the marker itself. Has the following attributes:
  * `code`: the numeric code of the marker.
  * `marker_type`: the type of object the marker is attached to (either `MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD`, `MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER` or `MARKER_ARENA`).
  * `offset`: offset of the numeric code of the marker from the lowest numbered marker of its type. For example, token number 3 has the code 43, but offset 3.
  * `size`: the size that the marker would be in the real game, for compatibility with the SR API.
* `centre`: the location of the marker in polar coordinates, as a `PolarCoord` object. Has the following attributes:
  * `length`: the distance from the centre of the robot to the object (in metres).
  * `rot_y`: rotation about the Y axis in degrees.
* `dist`: an alias for `centre.length`
* `res`: the value of the `res` parameter of `R.see`, for compatibility with the SR API.
* `rot_y`: an alias for `centre.rot_y`
* `timestamp`: the time at which the marker was seen (when `R.see` was called).

For example, the following code lists all of the markers the robot can see:

```python
markers = R.see()
print "I can see", len(markers), "markers:"

for m in markers:
    if m.info.marker_type in (MARKER_TOKEN_GOLD, MARKER_TOKEN_SILVER):
        print " - Token {0} is {1} metres away".format( m.info.offset, m.dist )
    elif m.info.marker_type == MARKER_ARENA:
        print " - Arena marker {0} is {1} metres away".format( m.info.offset, m.dist )
```
